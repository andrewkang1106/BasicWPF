# BasicWPF - MMF
Just learning and getting used to WPF while implementing interprocess communication (IPC) with memory mapped files.


* ServerWPF & ClientWPF are simple implementations with non-persisted memory mapped file (virtual MMF).

* ServerWPFLocalFile & ClientWPFLocalFile are implementations with persisted memory mapped file (physical MMF).
